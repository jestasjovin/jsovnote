### noted ideas, tasks, vision

//\*\*\*\* separating a framework, interfacing and core functionalities as diff modules
so as the system can be used in different machines, interactive systems ....

eg...a function to calculate integrals....
can put it in smart watch, robot.....or etc machines..without pre installing stiffz??

//multiple pages...
//rendering componrnts

///each block should have a name with different name.....
warn if exists

//TOD0.....
//saving the code as it is no trimming sapces
//saving results directly
//remembering last document
//running comments
// running global variables .....output and input req
// having multiple files like an ide....
// enabling packages
//black boxing mehods
//our file format
//...ai gateway for multiple lang/ or should change interpretation soln
// input /req algo functions....
//makin an app with this ...eg simple apps like modules which people can use
//in their sys
//other sys

//with github people setup everytime...this new way just go online and create in real time???
//

//who can use this
//_ designing a system that uses multiple languages as modules
//_ 1 way...create a file ...app and starts to code....//version control
...push
...merge

---

chat with it in each module:::::::

---

finally
after individual code generated... preserve history

::::testing each block if delivers expected outcome...

::::generating the build

::::::package for hosting....

////preview and logging

//package handling conflics resolving ....

errrors and new way of suugesting solutions simpleto understand
\*\*\*visually

hosting::::
a provider will...need you to pay for domain or use generated domain....
money payment gateway...registration...
server hosting

gives you the link....
or an apk

::::build..
call it .bravin ....with permission ...run it makes an app

===export as code....as an app file not built, ...module to existing apps

===see visually your app...conected relationships
